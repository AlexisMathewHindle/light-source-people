    As of November 2016, 31 countries worldwide are operating 447 nuclear reactors for electricity generation and 60 new nuclear plants are under construction in 15 countries. Nuclear power plants provide over 11% of the world's electricity as continuous, reliable base-load power, without carbon dioxide emissions.  The first commercial nuclear power stations started operation in the 1950s.

    Nuclear technology uses the energy released by splitting the atoms of certain elements. It was first developed in the 1940s, and during the Second World War to 1945 research initially focussed on producing bombs which released great energy by splitting the atoms of particular isotopes of either uranium or plutonium.  In the 1950s attention turned to the peaceful purposes of nuclear fission, controlling it for power generation. Today, the world produces as much electricity from nuclear energy as it did from all sources combined in the early years of nuclear power. Civil nuclear power can now boast 17,000 reactor years of experience and supplies almost 11.5% of global electricity needs, from reactors in 31 countries. In fact, through regional transmission grids, many more than those countries depend on nuclear-generated power.

    Nuclear Power makes up an essential part of the worlds power generation matrix.  There is a clear need for new generating capacity around the world, both to replace old fossil fuel units, especially coal-fired ones, which contribute a lot of CO2 emissions, and to meet increased expectations for electricity in many countries.  The World Nuclear Association projections suggest a 30% increase to 510 GWe in operation by 2030 and overall 41% increase to 552 GWe by 2035.
