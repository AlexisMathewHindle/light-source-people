                    The global shift to a clean energy economy keeps accelerating, creating millions of green jobs for workers around the world, and showing that decarbonisation and economic growth can go hand in hand.  There are currently over 8 million people worldwide working within the renewable energy sector, up from just 3 million in 2004.  As improvements in technology and lessons learned drive down the cost of renewable energy, this staggering rate of growth looks set to continue for decades to come.

Here at Light Source People our consultants have access to all relevant networks, job boards, CV databases and social media relevant to the Energy sector.  However, so does the rest of the recruitment industry.  Where we differ is the level of dedication, determination and tenacity we put in to every search to ensure that no stone is left unturned, nor any potential candidate slips through the net.
